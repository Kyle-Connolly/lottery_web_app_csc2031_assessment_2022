# lottery_web_app_csc2031_assessment_2022

This project was created for the CSC2031 Security and Programming Paradigms module assessment at Newcastle University.

Scenario:
"Newcastle University has decided to set up a Lottery scheme to raise money for local charities and has started to develop a prototype Lottery Web Application using the 
Python Flask framework. As a software security specialist, the university have asked you to help improve their prototype by designing and implementing some given security
requirements into the application."

The project covers the following topics:
- input validation
- authentication - includes MFA (Multi Factor Authentication) such as time based PINS and reCAPTCHA
- authorisation - includes RBAC (Role Based Access Control)
- cryptography - hashing, encryption and decryption
- error handling - with custom error pages
- secure random number generation
- security headers - CSP (Custom Content Security Policy)
- logging user events

Note: This repository excludes the .env file and database file, in order to protect and secure the application.
